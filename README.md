## How it works

* Select the position where you want to display the information. Above or below the post content.

* Add a title (optional)

* Check the elements you want to show to your readers. Number of words, characters and/or reading time.

* If you do not want to display an element simply leave it empty or do not check it.

## Translations

The plugin contains the parameters to translate it to any language using a plugin. I recommend the plugin loco-translate.
